Create Shard using MongoDB.

Step 1 : Create directory for config server, a meta-server to store meta data of shards. The directories can be created in same drive or different

Step 2 : Start the service mongod to Configure config svr in port no 27019. Execute the following service in a separate prompt(Ubuntu). Repeat the steps three times with different port numbers to create three config servers.

Step 3 : Create directory for shard server, database server to store partitioned database. Two number of shards and with replication factor 3

Step 4 : Create two number of shards and every shard server will have replica set with Replication Factor 3 using mongod service with parameters. The following service should be executed in a separate command prompt(Ubuntu )

Step 5 : Create primary shard server(Query Router) and members to replica set. The following command should be executed on command prompt (Ubuntu)

Step 6 : Exit from MongoDB shell, go to prompt and repeat Step 5 for Second sharded cluster of port 27100(Primary), 27101(Replica), 27102(Replica). Now steps 5 and 6 successfully created and configured two sharded clusters. The next step is to start mongos service and create link to config servers.

Step 7 : Create Query server and create link to config servers using mongos service with parameters.

Step 8 : Create link with MongoDB shard server to sharded cluster by executing mongo service on command prompt

Step 9: Apply Range based sharding, execute the following queries and find execution time of each.
  1.updateOne()
  2.updateMany()
  3.findOneAndUpdate()
  4.find()
    a. $get,$lte
    b.$all
    c.$elemMatch
    d.$slice
    e.$exists=true or false
    f.find().limit()
  5. MapReduce()
  6.Aggregate()
